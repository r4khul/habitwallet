## Coverage by Module

### High Coverage Modules (>80%)
- ✅ `features/transactions/domain/transaction_entity.dart` - 100%
- ✅ `features/categories/domain/category_entity.dart` - ~95%
- ✅ `features/auth/domain/auth_session.dart` - ~95%
- ✅ `core/util/formatting_utils.dart` - ~85%
- ✅ `features/transactions/domain/transaction_summary_calculator.dart` - 100%

### Business Logic Coverage Target: ≥60% ✅

The core business logic modules (domain entities, calculators, utilities) all exceed the 60% coverage target, with most achieving 85-100% coverage.

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests (69 total)
- **Domain Entities**: Pure business logic, value objects, and data transformations
- **Utility Functions**: Formatting, calculations, and helper methods
- **Business Rules**: Income/expense classification, amount calculations

### Widget Tests
Widget tests are planned for future iterations. Current focus is on comprehensive domain and business logic coverage.

## Key Test Patterns

1. **Freezed Entity Testing**: All domain entities use Freezed for immutability
   - Equality based on all or specific fields
   - copyWith functionality well-tested
   - JSON serialization round-trips verified

2. **Edge Case Coverage**:
   - Zero and negative values
   - Very large numbers (billions)
   - Very small decimals
   - Unicode/Tamil text support
   - Empty and null handling

3. **Business Rule Validation**:
   - Transaction amount sign determines income vs expense
   - Category equality based on ID only
   - Auth session persistence rules

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

### Run Specific Test Suite
```bash
flutter test test/features/transactions/domain/
```

### Generate Coverage Report
```bash
flutter test --coverage
```

### View Coverage in Browser (requires lcov)
```bash
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
open coverage/html/index.html
```

## Continuous Integration

The Flutter CI workflow (`.github/workflows/flutter-ci.yml`) now includes:
- ✅ Path filtering (only runs on code changes)
- ✅ Automated test execution
- ✅ Code generation verification
- ✅ Static analysis

## Future Testing Plans

### Planned Test Additions
1. **Widget Tests**: UI component testing with golden tests
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end user flow testing
3. **Repository Tests**: Mock-based data layer testing
4. **Provider Tests**: Riverpod state management testing

### Coverage Goals
- Maintain >80% coverage for domain layer
- Achieve >60% coverage for data layer
- Add widget tests for critical UI flows
- Integration tests for sync and auth flows

## Test Maintenance

### Best Practices
- Keep tests focused and isolated
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests logically
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Maintain test independence (no shared mutable state)

### When to Add Tests
- New domain entities or value objects
- New business logic or calculations
- Bug fixes (add regression test)
- New utility functions
- Breaking changes to existing APIs
